# Pandas_Flexible_Matrix


1)Generates a matrix of randomly generated ints where the user defines the number of columns and rows.
 
2)Generates a list of flexible titles for column naming. Ex. Depending on total # of columns, headers will 
range from [A,B,C-Z], [AA,AB,AC-ZZ], [AAA,AAB,AAC-ZZZ] etc

3)Converts the matrix to a dataframe and maps header titles to each column for easy reference

4)Computes the standard deviation for each column group.
